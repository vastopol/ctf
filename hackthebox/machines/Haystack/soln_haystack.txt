Port 80 isn't worthless, ie hints there
ELK stack
database of some kind
elastic search
something about the image of the needle
    when find something interesting search on port 9200
spanish ?
access a server, trigger a vulnerability, try using a debugger

for root
local service, see services running as root for changes
pivot from initial shell to another user
whats on the box -> documented -> vuln/exploit
see whats running as root
enumerate what you're allowed to do -> configs
the higher port/service works as a db and may contains something useful.

HTTP requesting:
trying to use the GET with elastic search to query database

User: google translate is your friend, but dont rely it too much, sometimes you do not need it.
This part is like CTF ish, so go ahead to process the image, unload the hint and use bit of brain power on the hint.

Root:
there are 2 more steps to root after you gain access to the user part.
The CVE is not really the CVE exploitable thing, it just tells you the vulnerability,
go back to square one if needed and to regain access to the server.
Once success, look for some build in features that cause the vulnerability and keep testing it,
if necessary, use some online debugger tools to debug it, it can save you some great amount of time.

make a quick googling on what that high port is used for. find the applications name and google how to talk to it. it is well documented.
when you´ve found some document, try to find how you can extract data from it. it will have something called _x...... thats what you want to utilize to make your query.
you will need to SELECT right command with _x..../s..

User: the higher service works as a db and may contains something useful. Important things does not require too many words.

root: this is a two step process. You need to become someone else before that you would be able to get the highest privs. Maybe something else. Check procs and owners.
To get root stay simple. Check what you can do, what you can read and how to bypass that filter. There is a giant rabbit hole, if something does not work, it will not work even if you will wait.
One last thing, it needs to be triggered.

The part of the root requires to see these 3 files that are in a folder and see their contents,
when looking in the documentation of l******h saw that there is an online Debugger to see the pattern and be sure of what you do
And finally it is required to run the event

If you just got user.txt you will need to become another user before root.
Your enumeration as that new user should point you the right path on the system.

For everybody: Change file names when trying to get the final step to root running!
It cost me hours to realize that modifying the same file over and over will not trigger execution...

KIBANA

have to switch user from security to kibana

possible security flaw

CVE-2018-17246	77		Exec Code File Inclusion	2018-12-20	2019-01-08	7.5	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial

Kibana versions before 6.4.3 and 5.6.13 contain an arbitrary file inclusion flaw in the Console plugin.
An attacker with access to the Kibana Console API could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code.
This could possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system.


ssh into box as security

cat /etc/kibana/kibana.yml

get a reverse ssh back
ssh -R 5601:127.0.0.1:5601 guest@10.10.14.163

go to kibana from local host
